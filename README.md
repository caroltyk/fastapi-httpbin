# FastAPI Httpbin

A clone of [Httpbin](https://httpbin.org/) written using the [FastAPI Framework for Python](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).


## Development

To run FastAPI Httpbin in development mode so that changes to the underlying Python files
are automatically reloaded:

- Directly
  - `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`
  - `./bin/dev.sh`
- Or, in Docker if you'd prefer:
  - `./bin/docker-build.sh`
  - `./bin/docker-dev.sh`
